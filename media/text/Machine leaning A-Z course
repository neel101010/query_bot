welcome to the machine learning crash course my name is Peter norvig so when I joined Google in 2001 my title was director of machine learning because I knew that that machine learning would be a valuable tool to help engineers at Google and everywhere else make sense of their data I didn't quite anticipate then how widespread the tools would become and how much demand it would be for engineers who are skilled at using them this course is designed to set you along the path to becoming a skilled practitioner of the art what you learn here will allow you as a software engineer to do three things betterfirst it gives you a tool to reduce the time you spend programming suppose I wanted to write a program to correct spelling errors I can make my way through lots of examples and rules of thumb like I before E except after C and after weeks of hard work come up with a reasonable program or I could use an off-the-shelf machine learning tool feed it some examples and get a more reliable program in a small fraction of the time second it will allow you to customize your products making them better for specific groups of people suppose I produced my English spelling corrector by writing code by hand and was so successful that I wanted to have versions in the hundred most popular languages I would have to start almost from scratch for each language and would take years of effort but if I built it using machine learning then moving to another language to a first approximation means just collecting data in that language and feeding it into the exact same machine learning model and third machine learning lets you solve problems that you as a programmer have no idea how to do by hand as a human being I have the ability to recognize my friends faces and understand their speech but I do all of this subconsciously so if you asked me to write down a program to do it I'd be completely baffled but these are tasks that machine learning algorithms do very well I don't need to tell the algorithm to do I only need to show the algorithm lots of examples and from that just have to be soft now besides the three practical reasons for mastering machine learning there's a philosophical reason machine learning changes the way you think about a problem software Engineers are trained to think logically and mathematically we use assertions to prove properties of our program are correct with machine learning the focus shifts from a mathematical science to a natural science we're making observations about an uncertain World running experiments and using statistics not logic to analyze the results of the experiment the ability to think like a scientist will expand your horizons and open up new areas that you couldn't explore without it so enjoy the journey and happy exploring
